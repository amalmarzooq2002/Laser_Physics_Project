# HeNe Lasers in Barcode Scanners: A Computational Physics Perspective

## Overview

This project explores the basic principles of Helium-Neon (HeNe) lasers and their application in barcode scanning. Simulations and analysis were performed using **Python** and **MATLAB**.

---

## Topics Covered

- HeNe laser operation (population inversion, optical cavity, laser modes)
- Cavity design and stability (ABCD matrix analysis)
- Barcode structure and scanning mechanism
- Advantages and limitations of HeNe-based barcode scanners

---

## Tools Used

- **Python**:  
  - Beam optics simulation  
  - Barcode decoding logic  
- **MATLAB**:  
  - Mode structure analysis  
  - ABCD matrix stability evaluation  

---

## Key Takeaways

- HeNe lasers emit at 632.8 nm using a He-Ne gas mixture.
- Barcode scanners use laser beams, optics, sensors, and decoders to read encoded data.
- HeNe lasers are stable and accurate but bulkier and more fragile than diode lasers.
